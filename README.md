# EcoAware

A smart home hackathon project designed for dynamic home balance — improving eco-awareness, automation, and comfort.

## Project Overview

EcoAware lets users monitor and balance home conditions by integrating sensors and intelligent automation. This project uses ESP32 and other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers and IoT principles to keep environments comfortable and energy-efficient.

## Features

- Sensor Integration: Supports temperature, light, and other smart sensors.
- Automation: Triggers alerts or actuators (like fans, lights, buzzers) for balance.
- Uses Google Home as well!
- Expandable: Add new sensors, outputs, or automations as needed.
